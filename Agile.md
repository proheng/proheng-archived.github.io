I found others' comments are valuable. It is worth checking them out.

## My takeaway

### SCRUM Guide is just a list of statements and definitions

SCRUM Guide only defines the framework, not methodology about do and donâ€™t.  So It leaves each team with great flexibilities about implementing their own daily rituals and practices. Of course, all the flexibilities should still demonstrate the ideas stated in the guide. 

## Are we agile or Agile? 

### What is Agile and agile
The word, __"Agile"__, should have a trademark attached to it in my option. A team claiming themselves as "a true Agile team", should  strictly adhere 4 well-known <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Agile Manifestos</a>.  

However, when you speak "Agile", people normally hear it as "agile".  I am not surprised that they would feel agile is just cow-boy style, random, no structure, informal, casual, no document,  no rule and even chaotic. Why this?  Many teams as snapshots of the human society are stuck.

### Waterfall has a good tradition

For centuries, we were taught with a simple principle of cause-and-effect. We firmly believe in it. The mind-projection has been so strong to shape the entire society since the Industrial Revolution. 
Manufacturing, mechanical engineering, civil engineering established the linear waterfall process and applied it since then. No one would question them nowadays. In fact, the waterfall process is well structural, productive and predictable in these industries. It almost becomes the default and safe choice for processing in other areas, such public service, legislation, health, research institute, sport and so on. (side note, Ant society seems to organise very differently from human society who has more than 1 kg brain... check this out, https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/401734785/getting-organized?showDate=2017-10-06) 

Back in software engineering, the software product is shapeless and invisible but highly scalable. It can be easily changed and updated the fit the business. The waterfall process our human-being follow simply not fast enough to keep track of the constantly changing business requirement and latest technologies.  

So after many software failures in the mid-90s, a few guys come up with something called, Agile Manifesto. No one truly believes it would work, because implementing the Agile in the way they suggest would bring the entire organisation upside down. Mangement tier will lose power to the worker tier as Agile encourage the team make the decision and share the responsibility while managers in the traditional organisation are regarded as a source of truth.  

Indeed, adapting true Agile is an organisational change. Without a good strategy, such sizable change may often lead to failure and leave the organisation at risk. 

### We are stuck because we fail to change. 

Recently, Agile gains enough public attention under strong marketing and a few exciting news. Many other IT teams want to give it a try. However, due to the many reasons, they fail very badly. Everyone gets a very bad experience from being "agile". It then creates a cognitive behaviour virtuous circle. The team switch back to waterfall over one night and stick with it, no one is allowed to mention "agile" anymore. Everyone sees it as bad as they can imagine. 


## Empiricism 

In my view, proper Agile (such as SCRUM) emphases empiricism, encourage the team to self-drive to explore a roughly known territory, discover the best practice and structure, then deliver the best business outcome possible. That is the reason "Inspection" and "Adoption" are two pillars in SCRUM Theory. These two ensure the team can continuously improve and evolve for the constantly changing business requirement.  Admittedly, this requires a huge amount of trusts within the organisation.  So, the SCRUM theory also set "Transparency" as the third but equally important pillar. 

Of course, sometimes empiricism may let the team find out their organisation doesn't have a good plan to support Agile. The team may be lack of support and understandings. Then, eventually, they may decide to abandon the ship and swim back. 

## At least we can do something
No matter whether we decide to take the adventure for the true Agile, here are the thing I believe we can do as a team.

### Timebox many meetings as possible
The human brain can only focus within a short period. After that, it gets fatigued, then starts daydreaming.  Short-term memory is also too scarce to hold no more than a 7-digit phone number at one time. So, to maximise the brain power in each meeting, try to time-box it and break a long meeting into a series of time-boxed sections. It would be even better to spread out the sections in different days if possible. 

### Retrospective
We may not need to hold a retrospective meeting regular if the team doesn't do SCRUM. But the team should have a common and well-maintained place to throw their ideas, likes and dislikes. Then, they may chat about them in formal or informal settings.
