The authors of Scrum, Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber, has just updated the notable SCRUM Guide after many years. 

## What is new

I found others' comments are valuable. It is worth checking them out.

## My takeaway

### SCRUM Guide is just a list of statements and definitions

SCRUM Guide only defines the framework, not methodology about do and donâ€™t.  So It leaves each team with great flexibilities to implement their own daily practices. Of course, all the flexibilities should be compliant with the guide. 

## Are we agile or Agile? 

### What is Agile and agile
The word, __"Agile"__, should have a trademark attached to it in my opinion. A team claiming themselves as "a true Agile team", should  strictly adhere to the 4 well-known <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Agile Manifestos</a> .  

However, when I speak "Agile" with people, they normally hear it as "agile".  I am not surprised that they would feel agile is just a cowboy style, random, no structure, informal, casual, no document,  no rule and even chaotic. Why is it?  It is because we have been very comfortable with the waterfall process.

### Waterfall has a good tradition

For centuries, we were taught with a simple principle of cause-and-effect. We firmly believe in it. We also find that our brain can easily manage the chronological events and tasks. During the Industrial Revolution, massive production in the manufacture and engineering require a significant amount of labour. To organise and operate such amount of human force, the linear waterfall model became the best choice for the manager in the hierarchical society and organisation.  Every big task can be broken down; every big responsibility can be sub-divided and sub-delegated, every lengthy process can be chopped into small chunks. 

Manufacturing, mechanical engineering and civil engineering established the linear waterfall process and applied it since then.  The waterfall process is well structural, productive and predictable. It becomes the default and safe choice for processing in other areas, such public service, legislation, health, research institute, education, sport and so on. No one would question them nowadays. It deeply shape our human society and our common philosophy of resourcing and management. (Ironically, Ant society seems to organise very efficiently without complicated communication, like meeting, contracting and negotiating. check this out, https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/401734785/getting-organized?showDate=2017-10-06) 

Back in software engineering, the software product is shapeless and invisible but highly scalable. The data can propagate beyond our imagination. The impact of the digital information is also uncertain.  The waterfall process, however, requires a well-established prior knowledge, so that it can form a structure, provide the estimate and predict the outcome. Longer the project, more prior knowledge and study requires. Unfortunately, every piece of IT technology we build is always unprecedented. Then the impact of the product is apparently hard to be quantified up-front. The technology, knowledge and market are also evolving every day. Now we cannot even predict whether Apple iPhone X would win the battle against Samsung Galaxy S phone. Are you willing to sign a 10-year contract to purchase whatever phones Apple or Samsung make in this 10 years?

At the beginning of the software engineering, people apply waterfall model. They also believe software engineering is as same as manufacturing lines. More men put on the manufacturing line, quicker the development should be, then less time it requires to release the software product. However, they gradually realised it is not the case.  So, it came such a good book, called, The Mythical Man-Month (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month). 

So after many years' failures and crisis, until the mid-90s, a few guys come up with something called, Agile Manifesto. No one truly believes it would work, because implementing the Agile in the way they suggest would bring the entire organisation upside down. Mangement tier will lose power to the worker tier as Agile encourage the team make the decision and share the responsibility while managers in the traditional organisation are regarded as a source of truth. (Nowadays, I found even universities do not teach Agile in their subjects of project management and software engineering. The core values of Agile are still a mystery in many's minds. )

Indeed, adapting true Agile is an organisational change. Without a good strategy, such sizable change may often leave the organisation at risk. 

### We may in the middle, then become non-Agile and non-waterfall.

Recently, Agile gains enough public attention under strong marketing and push from digital transformation. Many IT teams give their best effort to go Agile. However, they may experience many challenges over their capabilities. The progress of Agile adaptation gets slow down at some point in the journey. In terms of project management style, they are in the middle of the waterfall and Agile. The team members become miserable about "agile" simply because they cannot reach their distant dream destination and proudly claim themselves as "pure Agile".  Sometime, such experience may alter the team members' attitude toward Agile. It then creates a cognitive behaviour virtuous circle. 

## Empiricism 

In my view, proper Agile (such as SCRUM) emphases empiricism, encourage the team to self-drive to explore a roughly known territory, discover the best practice and structure, then deliver the best business outcome possible. That is the reason "Inspection" and "Adaptation" are two pillars of SCRUM Theory. These two ensure the team can continuously improve and evolve for the constantly changing business requirement.  Admittedly, this requires a huge amount of trusts within the organisation.  So, the SCRUM theory also set "Transparency" as the third but equally important pillar. 


## At least we can do something
No matter whether we decide to take the adventure to the true Agile, The things I believe could benefit every team.

### Timebox many meetings as possible
The human brain can only focus within a short period. After that, it gets fatigued, then starts daydreaming.  Short-term memory is also too scarce to hold no more than a 7-digit phone number at one time. So, to maximise the brain power in each meeting, try to time-box it and break a long meeting into a series of time-boxed sections. It would be even better to spread out the sections on different days if possible. 

### Retrospective
We may not need to hold a retrospective meeting regular if the team doesn't do SCRUM. However, the team should have a common and well-maintained place to throw their ideas, likes and dislikes. Then, they may chat about them in formal or informal settings.
