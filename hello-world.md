## The First blog: I am just a bit of minimalistic/lazy... 




So I write my first "hello world" in plain text. 

The website is built using Angular 2 and hosted on Azure App Service. 

All content is in source code in VSTS Git repo. 

I publish and update the website by auto CI and CD. 

Anyway, "Hello World!".

__More blogs will come soon.__
