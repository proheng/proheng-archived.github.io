## Why another blog

I set up this blog is to share my idea with the IT community in Canberra. I hope my ideas could help to improve Australian IT industry.

All the blog post will be maintained and up-to-date. Of course, each blog post is versioned controlled on Github. You can always dig up what I said in the past by viewing the commit history on Github. üòù

### A no-database, bespoke, plain text blog focusing on content

I am just a bit of minimalistic/lazy... I don't know 3rd party CMS framework. I have worked with Wordpress, Drupal, Sitecore and many others. I like the convenience the frameworks provide. But because I've spent too much time tweaking these frameworks, and become very picky about details, so I decide to build my own. 

The website is built using Angular 2 and hosted on Azure App Service. 

The architect is slim and simple. There is neither database nor back-end code.  This website has only one single HTML page.

All content are loaded dynamically on your browser. It is written in markdown format and hosted on Github in markdown format. That is why I said all content are version controlled. Please feel free to check it out at <a href="https://github.com/proheng/proheng.github.io" target="_blank">https://github.com/proheng/proheng.github.io</a>. 

The source code is in VSTS Git repo. Continue integration and continue deployment are automatically triggered by my ```git push``` command.
