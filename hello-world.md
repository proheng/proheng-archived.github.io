## The First blog: I am just a bit of minimalistic/lazy... 



So I write my first "hello world" in plain text. 

The website is built using Angular 2 and hosted on Azure App Service. 

The architect is very slim. There is no database and back-end code.  The entire website has only one single HTML page.

All content is written in markdown format. It is hosted on Github in markdown format. Please feel free to check it out at <a href="https://github.com/proheng/proheng.github.io" target="_blank">https://github.com/proheng/proheng.github.io</a>. 

The source code is in VSTS Git repo. Continue integration and continue deployment are automatically triggered by my ```git push``` command.

I set up this blog is to share my idea with the IT community in Canberra. I hope my ideas could help to improve Australian IT industry.

Anyway, "Hello World!". 

__More blogs will come soon.__
