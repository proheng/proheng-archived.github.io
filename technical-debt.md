# Technical Debt

There is no shortage of articles explaining “technical debt” in software engineering.

<a href="https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/technical-debt" target="_blank">Here is a very good article. </a> I highly encourage everyone to read it. 

Note that this article compares "technical debt" to the money we borrow from the bank. More money we borrow, greater our purchasing power is. Of course, we need to pay back eventually, the principle and the interest.

It also lets me think another term we often see. It is <a href="https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/borrowing-and-credit/home-loans/interest-only-mortgages" target="_blank">“interest-only”</a>. It means that we take the loan from the bank and only pay back the interest, not the principle. In software engineering, I could compare it to the situation where the team keep the technical debt in mind but seldom do anything to pay back the debt.  

Anyway, I am not going to echo the points in the article. But after reading the article, I would consider the following questions. I also recommend these to my team.

1.    How much technical debt does my project have?
2.    How do I pay it back and when?
3.    Do I actively monitor and manage the debt? 
4.    Is my team doing “interest-only”? Or we are paying back both the principle and the interest?
