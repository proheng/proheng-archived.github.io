__The following paragraphs record my thoughts based on my working experience. I hope it could also help to improve your team's code.__

__Code inspection and refactoring are just like servicing your car and keeping it in a health and safe state. The business may not see them as important as creating new features and fixing bugs. However, proactively inspecting and refactoring the code could gradually increase the team's velocity and reduce the chance of defeats. It is just like the well-serviced cars can run double even triple mileage to those without service and have less chance to break down on the highway.__

## What are the benefits?

The inspection and refactoring can also have the following benefits to the dev team.
    1. Better understand the code quality
    1. Better understand the implementation detail.
    1. Identify and clean up obsolete code which is no longer relevant to the business.
    1. Identify and fix code vulnerabilities. 
    1. Reduce chance of bugs
    1. Keep the code up-to-date with the latest technology and practise standards.


## How often should we inspect and refactor our code?

It is necessary to inspect and refactor the existing code as regularly as adding new features and fixing bugs.

It will keep the code in a healthy and maintainable state. 

Inspection and refactoring are on-going activities, just like servicing our cars or keep ourselves healthy. The team could dedicate a proportion of time regularly to undertake such task. However, I believe some following questions are highly recommended to each dev team member on a daily basis. 

When adding a new feature and fixing a bug, ask yourself:
    1. Do I take this as an opportunity to understand the code better?
    2. Could I try to improve the code and clean up some existing technical debt? 
    3. Do I communicate with the team about anything I have done with the global functions?

Also be aware that you are adding technical debt if writing code recklessly, or just rushing the release to cross the line. It could cost more effort to clean up in future, or even putting the entire solution at risk.
